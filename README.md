    ```  Index and Gains Table for Overall Response  ```
    ```    ```
    ```  The Overall Percentage of Patients with a Stroke or Heart Attack is 1.4794%  ```
    ```  The index is the Percent Response in the Decile divided by the Overall Response.  ```
    ```  For instance for the top decile the Index=11.1482/1.4794 or 7.536  ```
    ```  Patients in the top Decile are almost 8 times as likely to have a Stroke or Heart Attack  ```
    ```  The average score times the decile total should roughly equal to the number of patients with a Stroke or Heat Attack  ```
